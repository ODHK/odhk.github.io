Already? Yes already! It's time for our second meetup!
Come meet fellow Hong Kong Open Data enthusiasts to find out what Open Data is all about and explore your ideas. Whether you're already familiar with Open Data or want to find out just what it is, come to our regular meetup (happens every 3 weeks). 

Invite a friend! Bring two! We want to spread the news about Open Data in Hong Kong, especially as we ramp up toward our weekend hackathon "Make" jam May 18th.

Schedule (subject to change - feel free to arrive when you can):
7:00pm: Drink, mingle. Get a nametag, put it on. Get on the wifi.  Joke about closed data. 
7:30pm Topic discussions! With bonus MCing/nagging by [Wai-Chung Bastien]
