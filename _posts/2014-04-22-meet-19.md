Our speaker will be Kenneth Chen, Secretary General of the LegCo Secretariat. Kenneth will speak about the opportunities and challenges with Open Data for politics and legislation in Hong Kong.

With projects like “[Open LegCo](http://www.legco.gov.hk/general/english/open-legco/)”, the Legislative Council attaches great importance to the promotion of openness and public access to information about the work of the Legislature.

The Secretary General is the chief executive of the Secretariat, providing guidance and direction to the Secretariat’s 500 staff in supporting the work of the LegCo and managing the facilities and services provided in the LegCo Complex. The Secretary General is also Clerk to the LegCo and the principal adviser to the President of LegCo on procedural matters. He is responsible to the Chairman of the Commission for the effective management of the Secretariat with complete political impartiality.
