## Thirteen gaining steam!

This is our social meet to kick off an exciting year for ODHK. BYOB (Bring Your Own Beer / Drink of choice) and come socialize on a rooftop in Wan Chai. We'll talk Open Data, the community, the upcoming opportunities, and maybe even screen an Open Data movie "Money Ball".

Whether you're familiar with ODHK or new, come out and share a beer and join us in kicking off the new year.

Please RSVP by confirming on either G+ or Facebook so we can stay on top of numbers.
