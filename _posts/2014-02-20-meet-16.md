This event we’re finding out about R and energy data.

## Energy data

Waltraut, Guillaume and Eric are hacking energy data, and they’re getting it open. Find out what is the state of energy data – public and private – in Hong Kong. Energy data is critical for sustainable urban development, smart city planning and climate change mitigation. Both private and public organisations collect data related to energy generation and consumption, some of it, e.g. utility consumption data, is held by private companies.

## R stats programming language

R is very useful for journalists and data scientists to crunch sets of data to find trends and run scenarios. Guy Freeman and Fuk Chan of the Hong Kong R User Group will be giving us a practical overview of the R programming language that’s been getting people buzzing finding trends in statistical data and big data. They’ll be brazenly honest about it too – no pitches, just the low-down – how to use it, what to use it for, the shortcomings, the aggravations, and the awesome potential.
