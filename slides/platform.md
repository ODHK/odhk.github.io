# ODHK 2014 Tech Strategy



## What's ODHK's tech strategy for 2014?

### Platform for _Developers_, Platform for _Data_



# Open Platform



Supporting Developers with an Open Data Platform.

* Knowing what data is available
* .. and assistance in acquiring data which isn't
* Get people with complementary skill sets to contribute to your team
* Adopt suitable monetisation strategies if that's a priorirty for you
* Provide the technical infrastructure to host your application
* Maintain an index of Open Data Projects
* Feature and promote your project for maximum exposure.



## How do projects get involved with the Open Platform?

## Three tiers

* Outer Tier: **External**
* Middle Tier: **Affiliated**
* Inner Tier: **Supported**



Outer Tier: **External**

* Projects active with Open Data, but have no affiliation with ODHK
* Entry in Project Index.



Example Project: **[GigaDB](http://gigadb.org/)**

GigaScience is an online, open-access journal that includes, as part of its publishing activities, the database GigaDB. GigaScience is co-published in collaboration between BGI and BioMed Central, to meet the needs of a new generation of biological and biomedical research as it enters the era of “big-data.”



Middle Tier: **Affiliated**

* Projects which would benefit from our involvement, but want to set their own direction.
* Expertise on Offer (e.g. Data License, B2G Strategies, Stakeholder Negotiations)
* Promote the application and improve adoption rates.
* Hosting if the project is modest/non-commercial in nature.



Example Project: **[Kites](http://www.kites.hk/)**



Inner Tier: **Supported**

* Projects developed or maintained by ODHK developers.
* Hosted on the Open Platform Server
* Project Leads have their own Working Groups within ODHK with direct links to ExCom
* Projects are eligble for ODHK resources



Example Project: **OpenGov.HK**

* [German Deployment](https://fragdenstaat.de/)
* [Our Service](http://opengov.hk/)
* [Discussion Forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/opengov-hk)
* [Tasks](https://github.com/ODHK/opengov.hk/issues)
